You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

var myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

myDog["bark"]="woof";
