we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper";
Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper".

var myDog = {
  "name": "Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

myDog.name="Happy Coder";
