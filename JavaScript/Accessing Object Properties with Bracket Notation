The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, 
you will need to use bracket notation.


var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};


var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Change this line
