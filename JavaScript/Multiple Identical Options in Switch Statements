If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, 
the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. 
If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

function sequentialSizes(val) {
  var answer = "";
  switch(val){
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
    return "Low";
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
    return "Mid";
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
    return "High";
  }
  return answer;
}

sequentialSizes(1);
